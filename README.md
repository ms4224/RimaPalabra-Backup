Backup for RimaPalabra

RimaPalabra is a spanish rhyme dictionary.  It uses a trie of the entire dictionary to reverse alphabetize all of the words in the spanish dictionary, and from there closest matching rhymes can be found.  Click on the link above and give it a try.

You can visit original complete site at www.rimapalabra.com

I have removed some areas of the code for when it's made public on GitHub via request.

# Disclaimer!
This is one of my earliest projects.  If you're taking a look at the code, you'll notice there are ALOT of comments, sorry about that!
